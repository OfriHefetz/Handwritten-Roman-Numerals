# Handwritten-Roman-Numerals

Authors: Ofri Hefetz, Shai Shani Bar

## Our Task 
This project focuses on enhancing the performance of a pre-existing machine-learning model by manipulating a dataset of handwritten Roman numerals.

The key objectives involve data cleaning, dataset enrichment through augmentation, and addressing class imbalance. 
First, through exploratory data analysis, labeling inconsistencies and unrelated noise were identified, leading to manual cleaning of the dataset. 
Next, additional images were collected from various sources, including friends, family, and AI tools, followed by data augmentation techniques. 
Finally, class imbalance was addressed by balancing the dataset, and a split was done between training and validation sets. 
The results indicated ________. 

This project provides insights into improving model performance through data manipulation strategies.
